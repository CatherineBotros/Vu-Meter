# Audio-Voltage Transducer

The first step to creating a functioning Vu-Meter is to convert the given input into **usable input** for the circuit. The given input is the analog audio signal, but the circuit requires a digital input to operate.

This is where an audio-voltage transducer is needed. A transducer is defined by its Analog-to-Digital conversion (ADC) ability and are often used in digital products that interact with natural sources of input.

From my understanding, a microphone is an example of an audio-voltage transducer. 

However, microphones come in many varieties targeted towards a specific purpose, so in doing some research, I can find the one most suitable for this project.

My specifications include:
  - Function: Does it convert audio signal into voltage with a high degree of accuracy?
  - Size: Is the size small enough to fit on a 100mm by 200mm circuit board?
  - Weight: Does it weighless than 10g?
  - Cost: Is it within $3?
