# Vu-Meter
A Volume (Vu) Meter made with 20 LEDs that light up as the surrounding volume increases. 

Listening to music is one of my favourite pass-times, so I wanted to create a Vu Meter that can give me real-time feedback on how loud the music (or surrounding noise!) is. 

This repo is made to document my journey in understanding the fundamentals of circuit and PCB design from start to finish. This entails: 
  - The idea
  - Drafting the schematic & knowing what electronic components to use/how they work (with reference to datasheets)
  - Sourcing all the required parts from manufacturers
  - Printing the PCB
  - Soldering parts onto the PCB
  - Testing with various test cases
  - Analysis (i.e. what went well/what didn't, any unexpected issues, improvements that could be made, efficiency etc.)
  - Based on the analysis, a redesign based on my understanding will be made
  - Final product

Inspiration for this project comes from "Electronics Projects - Stefano91e". All due credit goes to him.
