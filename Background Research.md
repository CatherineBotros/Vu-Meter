# Background Research

Before delving into the technical concepts, I want to first have a general understanding on how Vu-Meters work and where they're applicable in the real world. 

Grasping a macro-understanding of the system will allow me to better perceive how each of the smaller functions work to serve a bigger purpose. In addition, relevance is a huge motivator when it comes to making a product. The "why" is just as, if not more important than the "how" since it asks whether or not this project has potential to benefit someone or something bigger than myself.
